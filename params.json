{"body":"Easily send messages downstream to a web browser on dedicated channels.\r\n\r\n## Redis backed Pub/Sub EventSource server\r\n\r\nESPubSub is a Go HTTP Handler which allows clients to subscribe to channels via\r\n**EventSource**. Event Source is a simple browser api for reading from a long\r\npoll connection. Browsers(except IE and Android mobile) support it.\r\n\r\nChannels receive data (strings) via a Redis PUBLISH command. ESPubSub\r\nwill need to connect to a running Redis server.\r\n\r\nThis has not been used in production.\r\n\r\nSome EventSource polyfills (which I have not tried)\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/remy/polyfills/blob/master/EventSource.js\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/Yaffle/EventSource\r\n\r\n### Demo\r\n\r\n    cd examples\r\n    go run server.go\r\n\r\nConnect to http://localhost:8080/ with your browser\r\n\r\nFrom the command line send Redis PUBLISH commands\r\n\r\n    redis-cli PUBLISH /events/alpha \"Hello Alpha\"\r\n    redis-cli PUBLISH /events/beta \"`date`\"\r\n\r\nThe demo shows has one channel(`/events/*`) using a glob to listen to multiple channels.\r\n\r\n## Made Possible By\r\n\r\nhttp://github.com/antage/eventsource and http://github.com/vmihailenco/redis\r\n\r\n# LICENSE\r\n\r\nCopyright (c) 2012 John Weir\r\n\r\nPermission is hereby granted, free of charge, to any person obtaining a copy of\r\nthis software and associated documentation files (the \"Software\"), to deal in\r\nthe Software without restriction, including without limitation the rights to\r\nuse, copy, modify, merge, publish, distribute, sublicense, and/or sell copies\r\nof the Software, and to permit persons to whom the Software is furnished to do\r\nso, subject to the following conditions:\r\n\r\nThe above copyright notice and this permission notice shall be included in all\r\ncopies or substantial portions of the Software.\r\n\r\nTHE SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED \"AS IS\", WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR\r\nIMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO THE WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY,\r\nFITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE AND NONINFRINGEMENT.
